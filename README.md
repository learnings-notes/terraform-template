This post is the first in the series which focuses on point 1 in the list, ‘how to structure your Terraform projects’.
Use a consistent file structure across your projects.
Use modules wherever possible.
Use a consistent naming convention.
Use a consistent format and style.
Hold your state file remotely, not on your local machine.
Avoid hardcoding variables.
Fewer resources in a project are easier and faster to work with.
Limit resources in the project to reduce the blast radius.
Test your code.
